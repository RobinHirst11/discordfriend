# Discord Friend Link

Generate Discord friend invite links to send friend requests directly through a link!

## What It Is

This script creates special Discord invite links that automatically add the person who clicks them as your friend. The links last for 7 days or 5 uses (whichever comes first).

## How to Use

1. **Open Discord:** Go to [https://discord.com/](https://discord.com/) in your browser.
2. **Wait for Load:** Ensure Discord is fully loaded.
3. **Open Developer Console:** Press F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I. 
4. **Go to Console Tab:** Click the "Console" tab in the developer tools.
5. **Copy & Paste Script:** Copy the script from [inject.js](inject.js) and paste it into the console. 
6. **Run:** Press Enter to run the pasted script.
7. **Use the Tool:** A window will appear allowing you to create and manage your friend invite links! 

**Please Note:** This uses a lesser-known Discord feature. The invite limitations (7 days/5 uses) are set by Discord and cannot be changed.
